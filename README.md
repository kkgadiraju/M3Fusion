# M3Fusion
This is a work in progress 

My implementation of the paper "M3Fusion: A Deep Learning Architecture for Multiscale Multimodal Multitemporal Satellite Data Fusion" by Benedetti, Paola, Dino Ienco, Raffaele Gaetano, Kenji Ose, Ruggero G. Pensa, and Stephane Dupuy

The code is in Tensorflow 2.+

You'll need to write a custom data generator to read the spatial and temporal data as well as specify the hyperparameters.
